  Create a function that uses yesterdayâ€™s partition to fully sort an array in-place.
  Unstable sort
  
  Time Complexity
    - Best: O(n log(n)) linearithmic
    - Average: O(n log(n)) linearithmic
    - Worst: O(n^2) quadratic
  
  Space: O(1) constant
  Params: nums, left, right
  - left and right are indexes, for now, left will be 0, and right will be the last idx
  - later these params will be used to specify a sub section of the array to partition
  Steps:
    - start by partitioning the full array (use the previously built partition algo)
    - then partition the left side of the array (left of the returned partition idx) and the right side (right of the returned partition idx), recursively
